# 🎯 **Year-Wise Subjects Implementation Complete!**

## 📊 **System Transformation Summary**

Your Smart Class Scheduler now supports **year-wise subject configuration** - allowing different subjects for different academic years within the same department.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Backend Changes (year_wise_backend.py)**
- ✅ **Year-wise subject storage**: `year_subjects` dictionary instead of flat `subjects` array
- ✅ **Department structure**: Each department can have different subjects per year
- ✅ **Constraint handling**: Year-specific subject limits and teacher assignments
- ✅ **Timetable generation**: Only assigns subjects appropriate for each year

### **2. Data Structure Changes**
```python
# OLD Structure:
{
  "departments": [{
    "name": "Computer Science",
    "subjects": ["CS101", "CS102", "CS201", "CS202"]  // Mixed years
  }]
}

# NEW Structure:
{
  "departments": [{
    "name": "Computer Science",
    "year_subjects": {
      "1": ["CS101", "CS102", "CS103", "CS104", "CS105", "CS106"],  // 1st year only
      "2": ["CS201", "CS202", "CS203", "CS204", "CS205", "CS206"]   // 2nd year only
    }
  }]
}
```

### **3. API Endpoints**
- **Port 8003**: Year-wise subjects backend
- **POST /timetable/setup**: Setup with year-wise subjects
- **POST /timetable/generate**: Generate year-appropriate timetables
- **GET /timetable/view**: View timetables filtered by year

---

## 📈 **Key Features**

### **1. Year-Specific Subject Assignment**
- **1st Year Students**: Only see 1st year subjects in their timetable
- **2nd Year Students**: Only see 2nd year subjects in their timetable
- **No Cross-Contamination**: Subjects stay within their designated year

### **2. Teacher-Subject Matching**
- **Teachers**: Can teach subjects from multiple years as needed
- **Constraints**: Teachers only assigned to subjects they can teach
- **Workload**: Balanced across years and subjects

### **3. Realistic Academic Structure**
- **6 Subjects per Year**: Standard academic load per year
- **Year Progression**: Different subjects for different years
- **Curriculum Compliance**: Matches real university structure

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **1. Setup Your Departments**
```json
{
  "departments": [
    {
      "name": "Computer Science",
      "years": 2,
      "year_subjects": {
        "1": ["CS101", "CS102", "CS103", "CS104", "CS105", "CS106"],
        "2": ["CS201", "CS202", "CS203", "CS204", "CS205", "CS206"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "teachers": [
    {
      "name": "Prof. Smith",
      "subjects": ["CS101", "CS102", "CS201", "CS202"],
      "department": "Computer Science"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **2. Generate Timetables**
- **Year 1 Classes**: Get CS101-CS106 subjects
- **Year 2 Classes**: Get CS201-CS206 subjects
- **Smart Assignment**: Teachers matched to appropriate subjects

### **3. View Results**
- **Student View**: Only see subjects for their year
- **Teacher View**: See all their assigned classes
- **Admin View**: Complete overview of all years

---

## 📋 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Backend Logic**
```python
# Get subjects for specific year only
year_subjects = dept["year_subjects"].get(str(year), [])

# Only assign subjects from this year's list
for subject in year_subjects:
    # Generate timetable entries for this year only
```

### **2. Constraint Enforcement**
```python
# Subject limits per year
subject_weekly_count[f"{class_key}-{subject}"] <= 5

# Teacher daily limits
teacher_daily_count[teacher_name][day] <= 4

# Year-appropriate assignments only
```

### **3. Data Persistence**
```python
# Saved to: timetable_data_year_wise.json
{
  "departments": [...],
  "teachers": [...],
  "timetable": [...]  // Year-wise assignments
}
```
